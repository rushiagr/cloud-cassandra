Cassandra on Cloud
==================

Install Cassandra on a fresh Trusty machine like so

    ./install-cassandra.sh jre-xuxx-linux-x64.tar.gz

As you can see, you will succeed only if you have Oracle's latest JRE tar file
at your hand.

Make sure you source `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` environment variables in
case you are behind proxy.
